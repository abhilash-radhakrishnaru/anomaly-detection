# Network Anomaly Detection using Deep Learning
This project contains codebase of anomaly detection in computer networks using deep learning models. Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, LSTM and Autoencoder based models are trained and evaluated using InSDN dataset. Data analysis has been performed to understand and decide on the preprocessings required. Multiple models have been developed using each of the algorithms.
Files are named as per the algorithm and iteration for easy identification
